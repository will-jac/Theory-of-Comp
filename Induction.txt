* We need a base case
	* Prove that this claim is true for some small value of the parameter (say k ) involved in the claim
* We need ot state the induction hypotheses
	* Assume that the claim is true for some value of the parameter that is at least as big as the value used in the base case
* Induction step
	* Trey to prove the claim for the value of the parameter that is the next integer above the one we used for the induction hypotheseis
